# coqui-stt

## NOTICE
The upstream project is now unmaintained, and they recommend switching to Whisper or another STT service.
I have written bindings for whisper.cpp as well, and you can find those over at https://github.com/tazz4843/whisper-rs.

A simple, yet feature-filled wrapper around the
[coqui-stt](https://stt.readthedocs.io/en/latest) C API.

Handles all low-level things for you.
All you need to worry about is passing in a valid model, optionally scorer, and audio.

If you'd like to, audio streaming is supported with the `Stream` class.

You can gain extended metadata about an audio result with the `Metadata` class.

Some hidden functions are also exposed in the Rust API with `#[doc(hidden)]`.

## On Windows

### Compiling your code

The Coqui-STT C libraries need to be discoverable by the rust linker. For that, you
can do either of the following:

-   Move them to a folder in your PATH variable.
-   Create a [build script](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html) and
    provide cargo with the path to the libraries with `cargo:rustc-link-search` or `cargo:rustc-link-lib`

### Running your code

The libraries also have to be discoverable by the executable. If you followed the first option
in the previous section, it will run with no extra effort; otherwise, you will need to copy the
libraries to your current working directory (`target/<profile name>` by default). It is recommended
that you use a tool such as [cargo-make](https://sagiegurari.github.io/cargo-make/) to automate this.

## On Linux

### Compiling your code

As for Windows, the libraries need to be discoverable by the rust linker.
You have a couple of options:

* Move them to `/usr/local/lib` or `/usr/lib`. This is the recommended way, if you have root
  access, and plan to run the executable on the same machine where it was built.
* During build, set the `LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to the path to where you have the unzipped
  `libstt.tflite.Linux.zip` file. This requires the corresponding environment variable during execution.

### Running your code

Just like with Windows, the libraries need to be discoverable by the executable. Static linking is not possible.

* If you followed option 1 above, as long as the libraries remain in the directory where they were installed,
  you should be able to run the executable without issues.
* If you followed option 2 above, you will need to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to the
  directory where you have the unzipped `libstt.tflite.Linux.zip` file. The libraries do not need to be in the
  same location as they were during build, as long as `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is set to the correct location.

## MSRV
